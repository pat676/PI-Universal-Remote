/*
 * A singleton class for simple one way comunication to one bluetooth peripheral.
 *
 * All discovered perpiherals with service UUID specified in the SERVICE_UUID constants will be stored as BluetoothDevice
 * objects in the bluetoothDevices array variable. No variables except delegate should be directly accesed, use given
 * functions to manipulate theese instead
 *
 * Known possible issues:
 *
 * When disconnecting a peripheral, the activeDevice variable will be set to nil immediatly, before the
 * centralManager(peripheralDidDisconnect) delegate function is called. This shouldn't be a problem since multiple
 * connections to peripherals are allowed by BLE. This might create problems when connecting to the same device several
 * times in fast succsesion, but no such issues were found during testing.
 *
 * I have not been able to reproduce the problem commented in: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13286487, where
 * "disconnected" devices will stay connected for an extended periode of time and therefor not be detected by the
 * peripheral scan. I assume this issue is fixed by coreBluetooth updates, but if devices arent found by the scan after
 * the first connection, this might be the issue.
 *
 * Both these issues have easy fixes, but i havn't implemented them to maintain optimal speed.
 * Two-way comunication wasn't needed, but should be easy to implement
