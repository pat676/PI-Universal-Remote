IOS Bluetooth app:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO:
- Add the swift source code for the bluetooth interface

This repository contains the bluetooth interface in swift that could be used by an IOS app. 
I am also working on creating an universal control app with customizable layouts, but 
since this is my first IOS project and it will contain a lot of features it will take some time to finish. 
In the mean time other apps exist that could be used, but they are not specialized for this kind of use. 

TODO:
- Finish and launch the app
- The interface is only created for sending bluetooth signals, not reading. The reason for this is that 
  remotes usually dont have the need for reading signals, but i am considering implementing this for debug  
  reasons.
