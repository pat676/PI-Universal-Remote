General:

Indentation style: Tab

In Try/Except blocks the except needs to specify exception. Do not use except blocks like
- except:
- except Exception as e:
- etc...

Functions that may fail and do not have spesific return values should usually return True on success and False else

Commenting style: Google, see: http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html

Logger:

General rules:
1) Always use __name__ for the name of the logger module!
2) All message should only have 1 severity code. Dont log the same message first to debug then error etc...
3) Dont spam the logger (read: loops...)
4) All rules are general guidelines and can be broken if necesarry

Debug logs:
1) log at begining of every function. This log should contian function parameters
2) log after user input, like terminal innput, bluetooth signal read etc...
3) log when relying on global constants. This log should contain the constant (Only once in each function)
4) log at branching when considered necesary
5) Include relevant parameters, but remeber debug logging is extensive and many parameters can be found in
   earlier entries.

Debug logs should normally not happen at:
- Before calling a function. (This will be taken care of when entering the function)
- Branching where the branch will directly call another function(Again taken care of when entering function)

Warning logs:
1) When someting happens that usually will be considered an error, but not necesarly, for example:
   The program can run without any sequence file, but if it doesn't manage to load the sequence file, it will usually be an error. This is a warning.

Error logs:
1) An error! Occasions that should never happen. The program will usually exit or return control to another
   module

Info logs:
1) Not extensivly used. Should be used instead of print if you want the possibility to "turn off" the print.
